		<b><h3>Overview</h3></b>
	This project brings the realistic shopping experience in an virtual (online) environment. Instead of having to go through a lots of product images to buy one as in Amazon and eBay, our virtual store has all the products in 3D stacked up in the shelves as in an actual store. Image below shows what a typical online store looks like and what  our virtual store looks like. In our virtual store, Customers can walk through the shelves, pick an item, rotate it 360, zoom-in to read the product description, and so forth.
